# CVE Search Application

This project is a web application that allows users to search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) by their CVE ID. The application fetches CVE details from the NVD API and stores them in a MySQL database for future reference.

- **notes.txt**: Notes and sample data related to CVEs.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the web pages.
- **index.html**: HTML template for the search form.

- **test.py**: Script for testing CVE fetching from the NVD API.
- **test1.py**: Another script for testing CVE fetching from the NVD API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- MySQL Connector

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujjanth/cve-search.git



Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Set up the MySQL database:

Create a MySQL database named nvd_cve.
Update the database connection details in app.py and app2.py.



## Usage


Run the application:
python app.py



Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).


Enter a CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2022-37966) and click "Search". The application will display the CVE details if found.


## Testing
You can use the provided test scripts to fetch CVE details from the NVD API:

test.py: Fetches CVE details by CVE ID.
test1.py: Fetches CVE details for a specific year and number of entries.

To run the test scripts, use:
python test.py
